Version 3.3.2

- Fix auto-completion of character extensions (e.g. V.O., CONT'D, etc.)
- Known issues are now tracking with FIXME comments in the source
- The html manual, although still in its infancy, is now built
  automatically on the server (or locally with make html-manual)
- The manual is available at https://fountain-mode.skeletons.cc
- Update repository for portability (add a screenshot, no more relying
  on GitHub stuff)
